&emsp; This project is intended to educate individuals looking to gain a better appreciation with our history and principals of the internet. We have been learning how rapidly the internet has grown in such a short period of time. Each day we continue to develope new ways to connect one another to information, resources and data.

&emsp; The internet is made up of independently operated network companies acting without ownership and available to the public, as designed from inception by Sir Tim Berners Lee. The evolution of this network has been revolutionary; marking its place in the pantheon of historical monuments such as the automobile and sliced bread. Computer’s ship binary information, known as “bits,” back and forth in a series of 1’s and 0’s. These can be relayed and transmitted in a few forms pending bandwidth and connectivity. Wireless connectivity uses radio wave to transmit data. Ethernet wires send bits far and wide but “light” is by far the most effective use for transmitting data known as “fiber optics.”
	
&emsp; Each computer has its own unique IP address, currently over I4 protocol. Internet Protocol allows one computer to physically communicate to another computer using 32 bits. IP Protocol was created in 1973 by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn. However, the telecommunications infrastructure has taken quite the journey along time.
